## What it does
This addon will give players a separate inventory, health, food level and experience for each gamemode installed and it's corresponding worlds. It will try to allow players to play each gamemode independently of another by forbidding share of above mentioned.

## An example
**BSkyBlock**'s Inventory, Health, Food level and Experience are shared only between it's corresponding worlds:
- BSkyBlock_world
- BSkyBlock_world_nether
- BSkyBlock_world_the_end

**AcidIsland**'s Inventory, Health, Food level and Experience are shared only between it's corresponding worlds:
- AcidIsland_world
- AcidIsland_world_nether
- AcidIsland_world_the_end

**Please note:**
- It is not limited to just BentoBox worlds. It applies to all worlds on the server (right now).
